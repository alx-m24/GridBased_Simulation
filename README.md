## Sand
For the moment, sand is the only feature available. To test it, just drag your mouse across the screen. Also, I think that sand is the easiest part of the simulation as it took me less than a day to implement it.

## Upcoming Features

Some of the feature i would like to add are: 
- [ ] Multi-threading
- [ ] Fluids
- [ ] Gasses
- [ ] Fire
